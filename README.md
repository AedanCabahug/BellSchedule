# BellSchedule
An updated version of the Palombi Bell Schedule that I created during 8th grade. The default schedule of this program is currently the remote learning bell schedule used at Grayslake North High School. There are more customization options in this version than the Palombi version. 

# Settings
The settings that can be changed are:

Rainbow Saturation: Sets how saturated the rainbow colors are
Rainbow Luminance: Sets how bright the rainbow colors are
Rainbow Speed: Sets the speed of the rainbow text
Rainbow Range: Sets the offset of the rainbow from one character to the next
Rainbow Type: Sets the type of rainbow animation (the only animations available are waves and static)
Text Color: Sets the color of the text when rainbow is disabled
Background URL: Sets the background of the clock
Military Time: Toggles 24 hour time
Clock Seconds: Toggles seconds in the clock

These settings can be adjusted in the settings window that can be toggled when clicking on the settings button on the bottom left of the page, or by changing their values in the main script which is found in "js/script.js". Be sure not to change any other variables except for the ones in the first two sections "customizable variables" and "add schedules here."

# Bugs
Make sure to report bugs in this program so that I can fix those bugs. This program is still being tested, so there are probably a lot of bugs right now.
